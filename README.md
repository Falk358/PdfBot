# PDFBOT

A chatbot for talking to your PDF files. The goal of this project is to get good performance with large documents. 
You need a python installation and Pinecone, Openai and HuggingFace accounts and api keys. Please fill these into the respective variables into the `.env_example` and rename it to `.env`.

I provide a `requirements.txt`, you can use pip to install the requirements automatically: 
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
